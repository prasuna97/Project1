    <h1> The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993. 
        Since then, there have been many different versions of HTML. 
        The most widely used version throughout the 2000's was HTML 4.01, 
        which became an official standard in December 1999. Another version,
         XHTML, was a rewrite of HTML as an XML language</h1>

    <h2> XML is a standard markup language that is used to create other markup languages.
         Hundreds of XML languages are in use today, including GML (Geography Markup Language),
          MathML, MusicML, and RSS (Really Simple Syndication). Since each of these languages was
           written in a common language (XML), their content can easily be shared across applications.</h2>
